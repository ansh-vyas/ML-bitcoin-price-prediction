## Introduction
Bitcoin, the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, has seen significant price volatility since its inception. Predicting its price can be valuable for investors and traders. This project aims to build a predictive model using machine learning techniques to forecast Bitcoin prices.

## Project Structure
The repository is structured as follows:
- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, and model development.
- `models/`: Saved models and related files.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing and model training.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Data Collection
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Yahoo Finance. It includes historical Bitcoin price data with the following columns:
- Date
- Open
- High
- Low
- Close
- Volume
- Adj Close

## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing steps include:
1. **Handling Missing Values**: Filling or removing missing values in the dataset.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features such as moving averages, volatility, and other technical indicators.
3. **Normalization**: Scaling the features to ensure they are on a similar scale.

## Model Development
Several machine learning models are developed and evaluated, including:
- **Linear Regression**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **Random Forest**
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks**

The models are trained on historical Bitcoin price data and evaluated based on their prediction accuracy.

## Model Evaluation
The models are evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The performance of each model is compared to select the best-performing model.

## Usage
To use the model for predicting Bitcoin prices, follow these steps:
1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bitcoin-price-prediction.git
    cd bitcoin-price-prediction
    ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. **Run the Prediction Script**:
    ```bash
    python scripts/predict.py --date YYYY-MM-DD
    ```

## Results
The best-performing model is the LSTM network, which shows the lowest prediction error. The model's predictions are visualized alongside the actual prices to demonstrate its accuracy.
